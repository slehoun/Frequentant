Frequentant
-----------

A frequency response analyser. Utilizes `alsaaudio` for input and `simpleaudio` for output. Generates sine waves in musical notes frequencies on the fly and plays them back while another thread captures them. Results are then analyzed and frequency response [bode plot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bode_plot) is generated.
